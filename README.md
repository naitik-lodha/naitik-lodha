## üöÄ About Me

I'm a 17-year-old student and developer with a passion for full-stack development. Currently, I am exploring a wide array of technologies including React, Tailwind CSS, and diving into the Next.js framework. My interests extend to the MERN stack, and I'm curious about exploring the realms of Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and mobile app development.

I enjoy the creative process of building applications and finding efficient solutions to problems. As I continue to learn and grow, I'm excited about delving deeper into various tech stacks and learning from hands-on experiences.
